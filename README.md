# Breast-cancer

### Cancer Detection using Deep Learning (Adapted from Potato Disease Classifier)

## üìå Overview

This project is an adaptation of the **Potato Disease Classification Deep Learning Project** by [CodeBasics](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLeo1K3hjS3ut49PskOfLnE6WUoOp_2lsD), originally designed to detect diseases in potato leaves using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with TensorFlow.

Instead of classifying potato diseases, we restructured and trained the model to **classify breast cancer images** using histopathological scans. The primary objective is to detect whether a given tissue image indicates **malignant** or **non-malignant** cancer.

## üîç Problem Statement

Breast cancer is one of the most common cancers among women globally. Early detection through histopathological image analysis can significantly improve patient outcomes. This project uses deep learning to automate the classification process.

## üß¨ Modified Dataset

* **Dataset Used**: [Breast Histopathology Images](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paultimothymooney/breast-histopathology-images)
* **Description**: Microscopic images of breast tissue, labeled as:

  * `0`: No cancer (non-malignant)
  * `1`: Cancer (malignant)
* **Image Format**: `.png`, 50x50 patches
